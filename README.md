# Prisma Vault

A sophisticated yield-generating vault built on Hyperliquid that implements automated leverage strategies to maximize returns for users through a proven Boring-Vault architecture.

## üåü Overview

Prisma is an automated vault system that creates leveraged yield opportunities by:
- Implementing staking mechanisms through stakedhype.fi
- Utilizing Felix Vanilla Markets for collateral management and borrowing
- Creating leveraged loops that amplify yield generation
- Providing secure deposit/withdrawal functionality with shares-based tracking mechanism and access controls

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Hyperliquid Protocol**: Underlying blockchain infrastructure

## üìä Strategy Details

### Leveraged Loop Mechanism
1. **Initial Deposit**: User deposits native hype
2. **Staking** : Stake it to get stHype, which will next be supplied as collateral
3. **Collateral Supply**: Funds supplied to Felix Vanilla Markets
4. **Borrowing**: HYPE tokens borrowed against collateral
5. **Re-staking**: Borrowed assets re-deployed for additional yield 
6. **Loop Amplification**: Process repeats to maximize leverage efficiency


## Testing
1. Created mocks for all necessary contracts
2. Tested those mocks to ensure reliabilty
3. Tested boring-vault's individual components using unit testing
4. Mock tested all the external interactions
5. Mock tested the looping strategy
6. Mock tested user flows of deposit and withdraw
7. Fork testing(WIP)
